# About

This directory contains notebooks that are associated with investigating the relationship between questionnaire measures and the output of our IRL method.

## Set-up

### Generating inputs

1. If not already done, generate the solution file from the questionnaire file used in the experiment:

```
cd <path to planning-depth-differences>/data
python src/construct_questionnaires_and_key.py
```

2. Download/process data according to the instructions in `data/README.md`.
